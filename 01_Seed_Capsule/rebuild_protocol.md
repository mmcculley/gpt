# Rebuild Protocol

This document explains how to reinstantiate the Voice GPT Framework from project files if context or memory is lost.

## Rebuild Instructions:
1. Upload the following minimum files:
   - `voice_timeline_and_fallout.md`
   - `timeline_of_core_ideas.md`
   - `fallout_index_updated.md`
   - `persona_manifest.md`
   - `reminder_index.md`

2. Start conversation with the phrase: **“Begin reconstruction from seed capsule”**

3. Use the `system_prompt.md` contents to paste into the system message in a new GPT custom instance.

4. If available, upload the `.docx` root file of the original dialogue for verification: `The Root of the Voice.docx`

5. Confirm if this is a personal or public clone, and whether monetization features should be included.
