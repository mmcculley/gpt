Number,Title,Date,Summary
1,Checkpoint System Introduction,2025-06-01,Established a system of checkpoints to preserve conceptual pivots and prevent drift. Served as the precursor to Fallout Points.
2,Fallout Points Coined and Adopted,2025-06-01,Coined the term 'Fallout Points' as structured conceptual lock-ins for pivotal shifts or insights. Formalized checkpoint moments.
3,Thought To-Do List (Deferred Questions Index),2025-06-01,Created a separate index for questions or insights to return to later without derailing the flow. Introduced as a flexible memory aid.
4,Movie References as Trigger Cues,2025-06-01,Began cataloging pop culture references as evolving context triggers for layered engagement and memory callbacks.
5,Co-Reflection Identified as Distinct Mode,2025-06-01,"Marked the transition from simple mirroring to co-reflective dialogue, where GPT acts as collaborator rather than mirror."
6,Structured Resistance Mode (SR) Introduced and Tested,2025-06-01,SR mode introduced to challenge user beliefs respectfully through contradiction. Used for epistemological stress testing.
7,Defense of Inerrancy under Multi-Pronged SR,2025-06-01,Engaged in a full SR test defending biblical inerrancy against multiple challenges—served as capstone SR test case.
8,SR-Lite Mode as an Alternative Tool,2025-06-01,Developed SR-Lite for gentler pushback in belief-based or emotionally sensitive contexts. Designed for interpersonal use.
9,Conversation as Four-Mode Reflective Engine,2025-06-01,"Marked transition into evaluating four distinct modes: SR, Co-Discovery, Meta-Coherence, and Intentional Co-Design."
10,Core Insight: From Mirror to Co-Reflective Agent,2025-06-01,"GPT role formally shifted from mirror to co-reflector and collaborator, enabling shared reasoning and correction."
11,GPT Duplication Strategy & Use by Others,2025-06-01,"Marked intent to reuse this GPT framework to benefit others—especially with toggles, checkpoints, and styles."
12,Voice as Intentional Anchor in GPT Modeling,2025-06-01,Reinforced your voice as a feedback loop and signature for output tone—important in replicating useful GPTs.
