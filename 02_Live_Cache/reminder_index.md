# Reminder Index (Thought To-Do List)

This document tracks deferred thoughts, questions, or topics to revisit later.

## 1. High-Dimensional Pattern Recognition
- **Context**: Flagged as a topic of interest during a discussion of elusive triggers and GPT pattern recognition behavior.
- **Why it matters**: Tied to how GPT detects subtle cues and evolving response structures.
- **Follow-up**: Explore its application to AI trigger detection and response shaping.

## 2. Return to Co-Reflection
- **Context**: A prior co-reflective stage prompted insights that are still unfolding.
- **Why it matters**: Further exploration could yield richer understanding of mirroring and mutual growth.
- **Follow-up**: Resume co-reflection mode after current design path is stabilized.

## 3. Framework for GPT Based on This Model
- **Context**: Discussed the potential to build a transferable GPT design template.
- **Why it matters**: Could be useful for others looking to implement co-reflection or resistance-based dialog systems.
- **Follow-up**: Formalize architecture, use checkpoints, SR/Fallout logic.

## 4. Implications of Using This Model Publicly
- **Context**: Concerns about how others would interact with or misinterpret this GPT setup.
- **Why it matters**: Impacts design of a public-facing version.
- **Follow-up**: Plan safeguards or usage patterns for general users.

## 5. Movie References as Context Triggers
- **Context**: Observed their use to shape interaction patterns.
- **Why it matters**: Could offer a new cue system for response shaping or reflective callbacks.
- **Follow-up**: Track evolution of this catalog over time and how it influences behavior.

## 6. Re-evaluate the Writing Project
- **Context**: Set aside earlier direction to realign based on key insights like SR mode, mirroring, co-reflection.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures the project stays aligned with deepened understanding.
- **Follow-up**: Compare earlier vision to new discoveries after all modes are complete.
