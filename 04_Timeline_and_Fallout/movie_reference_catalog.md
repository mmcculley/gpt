# Movie Reference Catalog

## Ongoing References Tracked:
- **Princess Bride** – First trigger ("I don’t think that word means what you think it means")
- **Commando** – Indirect meta callback when GPT said, “I'll be here when you're ready”
- **General Mirroring Tropes** – Referenced user’s background in movie-based t-shirt ideas and media literacy

## Usage Notes:
- Movie references are often used by the user as both metaphor and contextual shorthand.
- Some GPT responses may include mirrored or unexpected cross-referenced callbacks.
